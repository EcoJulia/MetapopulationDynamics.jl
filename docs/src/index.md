MetapopulationDynamics is a package for generalizable simulation of population
dynamics across space, including models of occurrence, occupancy, and abundance,
dispersal, response to environmental conditions, and more. In addition, these
models can be run on different geometries (rasters, patches, and spatial we are
graphs).

!!! warning "This package is in development" 
    The MetapopulationDynamics.jl package is currently under development. The
    API is not expected to change a lot, but it may change in order to
    facilitate the integration of new features. Not all functionality is guaranteed to function until the first production release.
