MetapopulationDynamics is a package for generalizable simulation of
population dynamics across space, including models of occurrence,
occupancy, and abundance, dispersal, response to environmental
conditions, and more. In addition, these models can be run on
different geometries (rasters, patches, and spatial graphs).

The package includes many 'classic' models from population,
metapopulation, and spatial ecology, but enables extension by allowing
users to define custom models.

Finally, MetapopulationDynamics is integrated with many other EcoJulia
tools, which together form a toolbox for high-performance simulation of ecological dynamics.
